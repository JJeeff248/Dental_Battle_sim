# Dental_Battle_sim

You are going to develop an RPG battle simulator that will be designed to teach young people about dental hygiene.
The simulator will allow the player (a dental hygiene advocate) to battle a computer opponent (causing bad dental hygiene). The format of the battle will be turn based with random elements included. A user should be able to make a decision about the sort of attack (or weapon) they will choose. The amount of damage for each successful attack (by both player and computer) will be determined by the selected attack, as well as a random component. The battle will continue until either the player's or computer's character is defeated (it may take several attacks for a player to be defeated.
The thematic elements of the game must promote a message of dental health.
